Validate to CPF

In this script I used a very simple method to validate CPF, excluded a invalids CPFs (invalidos = ['000.000.000-00','111.111.111-11','222.222.222-22','333.333.333-33','444.444.444-44',
                     '555.555.555-55','666.666.666-66','777.777.777-77','888.888.888-88','999.999.999-99'])

I'm not expect which is the better way to do this, but this is my way :).
